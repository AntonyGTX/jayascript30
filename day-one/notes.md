What is data atribute?
    The famous atribute we always is "class", "id", "src", "href" and so on
and when we want to use our own alributes in the html we use a custom altribute
and that custom is created with the help of data atribute
Example

    data-myAltribute

and this how you create a custome atribute and custome we can use is anything after we type "data-"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Altribute Selector
-------------------------

An alribute is the process of getting access to a specific html element and this is done by using the DOM
and which is called "document" and the one we are using is "querySelctor"

For example we are selecting an audio element

    document.querySelector('audio')

If you want we can get a copy of this selection by using a 'Variable'

    const audioTracks =  document.querySelector('audio');
